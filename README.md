In this presentation, I am going to talk about how to build high quality Openshift applications by using SOLID principles on the application development side and the Openshift infrastructure side, leveraging design patterns, test driven development, test pyramid and other devleopment best practices.
At the end of the presentation, we will have an open discussion Q&A to share some experiences we have about building high quality Openshift applications at the client sides.
We will go through a simple retrospective exercise and review some of the pain points that consultants may have about quality, and come up with a list of action items.
